brief introduction about me.

I started to learn about programming on my own after I graduated from high school I tried to apply for university but they rejected me so I had a gap year.

I decided to learn c++ as my first language because it was widely recommended as your first language 
and it was so hard specially pointers , OOP, loops and functions.

it took me around 6 months to grasp it but even after that I didn't know what I should do with it 
**Note that back then I only know the basics of English so I was learning in my native language Arabic and the learning resources in my language are so poor**.

Also at that time I didn't know the importance of building projects so I was only learning passively.

After a month of not knowing what I should with c++ I decided to learn Java and get into android development world however that decision didn't last for long because my laptop couldn't run Android Studio
that when I begin learning Javascript and web development.


## why I decided to become a Javascript full stack developer
<br></br> 

Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in our time and the language of the web.

that's one of the reasons why I decided to learn full stack javascript development also there are a lot 
of job opportunities for a full stack javascript developer.

## what I have learned of full stack javascript development so far
<br></br> 

I learned the basics of web development like html ,css and javascript.

I have built 1 or 2 static webpages with html and css only and I have also built 

2 small projects with the three of them the projects were a ToDo app 

and a memory game **the memory game took me around 3 months to complete**

I tried to build other projects also like a tip calculator but I stoped in the middle.

I also learned the basics of reactjs from Scrimba website which is an amazing platform to learn from 

but I haven't use it since because I was trying to make more projects with vanilla Javascript .

The project that I am trying to build now is a Tetris game and it's the hardest project for me so far.
